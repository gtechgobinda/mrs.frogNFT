This project demonstrates how to deploy NFT using hardhat, 
Language and tool: Solidity, JavaScript, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Alchemy, Pinata API,web3.js,ether.js
✔**Solidity** for creating contracts.
✔**JavaScript** for deploy & testing.
✔**Hardhat** for an environment use to test, compile, deploy.
✔**OpenZeppelin** provides a complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum        projects.
✔**Alchemy** is a developer platform that helps companies to build scalable decentralized applications without the hassle of managing blockchain infrastructure in-house.
✔**Pinata API** helps to upload NFT image and meta-data.
✔**Web3.js & ether.js**  enables to fulfill the second responsibility: developing clients that interact with The Etherem Blockchain.
